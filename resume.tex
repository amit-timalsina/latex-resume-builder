\textbf{Consultant} \hfill Remote\\
\textit{Senior Software Consultant (GenAI, ML, Backend)} \hfill September 2024 - Ongoing\\
{Consulting on LLM integration for extraction, RAG, Agentic use-cases.}
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 0pt
	\item Built custom PDF parsing solution for clinical trial documents that improved entity extraction accuracy by 50\%+ by solving cross-page entity detection and reducing LLM tokens by 70\%. Enabled enterprise client to build analytics product for stakeholders.
	\item Led end-to-end data extraction systems for clinical trials and document processing startups, improving accuracy vs. previous LayoutLM models. Built OMR extraction solution in 1 week for startup client, deployed to production in 2 weeks.
	\item Processed 200k clinical trial documents enabling new analytics services (e.g., "How often is age inclusion criteria used in trials?"). Handled rate limits, edge cases, and tight deadlines across multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, Llama, Mistral, Qwen).
	\item Built RAG chat application over clinical trial data in Snowflake achieving 95\% recall@10. Internal stakeholders reported high satisfaction, product ready for customer deployment.
	\item Implemented Langfuse for LLM observability, reducing debugging time by 80\% and enabling customer-level spend tracking. Led cross-functional collaboration with SRE team for in-house deployment.
